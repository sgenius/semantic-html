                The tag <code>p</code>p means "a paragraph". It is not considered semantic, because it can apply to any text regardless of its meaning.

                <ol>
                    <li>The <code>section</code> tag is semantic. Think of a newspaper:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Sports" is a section within it.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The <code>ol</code> and <code>li</code> tags are not semantic: they can be used in different contexts and do not carry additional meaning.</li>
                    <li>You <strong>can</strong> mark the header and footer of a section - but can be useful. </li>

                <h3>The <code>figure</code> tag</h3>
                <p>The <code>figure</code> tag is multifacetic! Think of it as an illustration in a book.</p>
                <!-- The "img" tag shows an image in the browser, but it has no meaning (although the "alt" tag can provide meaning.)-->
                <!-- Wrap it in the "figure" tag and add the "figcaption" tag to give it a semantic context. -->
                <figure>
                    <img src="pexels-brett-jordan-998501.jpg" alt="A paper tag". />

                <p>You can also use it to put some example code.</p>
                <figure>
                    <pre>
                        const a = 1;
                        const b = 2;
                        const c = a + b; // 3
                    </pre>
                </figure>

                <p>By the way, <code>code</code> is semantic (it means "this is programming code") while "pre" is not (it's just "preformatted text").</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Disclosure:</summary>
                Please note that the <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> tags are also semantic.
                You have reached <meter id="page-percentage" min="0" max="100" value="95">95 percent</meter> of the page. (<code>meter</code> is semantic.)
